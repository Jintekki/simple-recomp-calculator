### Formulas
Jeff Nippard has several charts in his guide to calculate how much fat and protein you should intake. I derived the formulas based on the visual charts he had in his book. 
##### Males
- Fat: (body fat percentage * 0.75) + 16.25 = total kcal in fat
- Protein: ((0.016 * body fat percentage) + 1.12) * LBM = daily protein intake
##### Females
- Fat: (body fat percentage * 0.5) + 15 = total kcal in fat
- Protein: ((0.0125 * body fat percentage) + 1.1) * LBM = daily protein intake
